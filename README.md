#README
1. Program language: C++

2. API: GDI+

3. Software& Compiler: Visual Studio 2013

4. Relevant files:
map.jpg: Assistant file to get the coordinates of the vertices.
original_map.jpg: The original map graph which we can open and edit.
original_map_with_label.jpg: The original map with labels on each vertex for user to simply name the vertex to draw resultant path from. The labels were generated by GDI+ in advance.

5. Generated file:
color.txt: Automatically generated by the exe to record some key pixels such as vertices.
result.jpg: The result file which you can see the final outcome.

6. Run Instructions:
Execute the exe file or the project attached, input the label of the specific vertex (according to original_map_with_label.jpg ) which you want to draw resultant path from. Then choose the algorithm from all of the 3.
Ps: I also attached the whole project just in case the exe file canâ€™t be executed as well as the cpp file and exe file.
